quests are structs that live in a list in the game script.
Because quests live in list you can call them with by list index.
Because they also live in structs you can call a quest by its "id" variable with the function get_quest_by_id.

{
	name: "Exit Room",
	completed: false,
	id: "q1",
	meta:{
		type: "room",
		room: MistHouse,
		leaving: true,
	}
},

	name| string: The name of the quest.
	completed| bool : A variable that helps determine if the quest is completed or not (should be set to false by default).
	id| string: A variable that determines the id of the quest. (should follow the increment order)
	meta| struct: {
		type| string: the type of action that will complete the quest.[THIS IS REQUIRED FOR EVERY "meta" STRUCT]
		
		(
		"room": Change room action-{
			type: "room", action type
			room: MistHouse, A GMRoom asset of the room that will trigger the quest completion
			leaving: true, A boolean value that checks if the quest requires you to enter or leave a room for the quest to complete.
		
		}
		"speech": Dialog action-{
			type: "speech", action type
		},
		"battle": battle action-{
			UNDER WORKS
		
		},
		)...
