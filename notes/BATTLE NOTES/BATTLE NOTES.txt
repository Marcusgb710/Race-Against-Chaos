NEW- You can't walk away from a bossfight. FLEEing isn't an option.

- Defending increases 5 pp to the defender. This system makes both
defending a more valuable option while also giving the player a chance
at strategy for certain fights.

- You can't flee in bossfights. That'll probably break something.

- Edgar's first fight has the strategy of "You need him to be asleep so you can do
more damage to him". The way I coded this initially was having edgar have the exact 
same health as you, while being able to do slightly more damage than you. However,
with the way the sleep system worked, this was very rng based and would either 
guarantee a loss or make the fight excrutiatingly easy because spamming attack was
actually the better strategy.

- Edgar NEO's fight basically went the same direction. Melee isn't good enough,
you're fighting a robot. You need to use magic, but while he's asleep. Edgar can
take a member out in 2-3 strikes in this fight, so you need to be cautious. All of
this made sense until I discovered you could once again beat him quick by spamming 
attack. Trying to be strategic actually made the fight LONGER and annoying.

- Edgar NEO was also planned to have stun abilities. Quick robot bonk, lights out
for a party member.

- Edgar is beaten by Misty alone.

- Edgar NEO is beaten by Misty, Jon, and Kelsi. Cory is nowhere to be found, probably
fell asleep somewhere.
