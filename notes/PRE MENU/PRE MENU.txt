All the pages are stored in struct objects. 
each object is similar but the page your on determines how the struct is outlined

if you go into the obj_menu_v2 object and look at pages youll see each page has a type which i used to help determine what
functionality is being used with each page.

The selecting mechanics are highkey botched they worked so i pushed so if you want feel free to change that as well.

ill leave regions for each section and have little notes on what each part does
